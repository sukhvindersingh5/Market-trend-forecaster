Google Nest Mini,the nest mini is a great deal for your first smart home speaker and a simple solution if you want to extend the google assistant experience into other parts of your home it lacks the musicality of the bestsounding bluetooth speakers and youll need to subscribe to spotify google play music or youtube music to get specific songs to play ondemand but at this price these issues arent dealbreakers,,,,web_scrape

Google Nest Mini,for years google has been selling its insanely cheap smart speakers to great success first with the name google home mini and now with the name google nest mini,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,whatever name it currently goes by these multipurpose speakers serve as both a gateway to the smart home by way of google assistant and a solid speaker that can be controlled with your voice or through your phone with bluetooth,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,the finished result is an entrylevel smart speaker that doesnt have the same power or clarity of say the apple homepod amazon echo studio or google home max but its low cost and spectacular feature set makes it a great jumping off point for folks just getting into smart home voice control and automation,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,update theres a new google nest speaker in town and its called the google nest audio with a new design and upgraded sound quality it costs 99  89  au149 and is available to preorder now it launched alongside the pixel 5 and a new chromecast at the companys launch night in event on september 30,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,what googles mini smart speaker is most for however is its rockbottom price  the google nest mini is supposed to cost 4999  49  au79 but is often on sale for just 35  35 sorry australia its still the regular price there,,,,web_scrape

Google Nest Mini,its affordable sticker price puts it in line with almost any budget bluetooth speaker youd buy on amazon and almost none of those can match the nest mini in terms of feature set in fact the only other speaker in remotely the same weight class as the nest mini is the amazon echo dot  which also costs just 35  29  au79,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,well cover the differences in performance and design below but for now the main takeaway is that this is both one of the cheapest speakers and the cheapest brandname smart speaker on the planet right now,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,in spite of the nest minis affordable sticker price theres nothing about its design that alerts you that this is indeed a cheap speaker the design is modern clean and unobtrusive especially if you buy it in a subtle color like chalk offwhite or charcoal greyblack if you want to spice things up with the two more colorful options  coral pinkred or sky light blue  you can certainly do so but those might not fit with everyones living room decor,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,regardless of which color you go for the nest mini has a fabric mesh on top that covers three touchcapacitive buttons for raising and lowering the volume and playpause on the underside youll find a rubberized base that compliments the fabric mesh and hides a microphone mute button on the back side near the power port last but not least on the underside youll find a place for a universal mount for easy hanging on a wall  a first for googles speakers,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,what you wont find anywhere on the nest mini is a 35mm lineout jack that could in theory connect to any other speaker or a linein aux port that would allow you to connect your phone or mp3 player to boost your music youll find the former on the amazon echo dot 3rd generation that was released a year prior to the nest mini and the latter on last years new amazon echo for neither one to be on the nest mini feels like a bit of a misstep,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,the good news though is that the nest mini can connect to your smartphone via bluetooth 50 so theres always that option too if you need it,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,while the addition of bluetooth is great and as youll see in a minute desperately needed the primary way of interfacing with the google nest mini is obviously google assistant,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,if you tried other virtual assistants like siri alexa or bixby in the past or have tried google assistant on another android device youll know what to expect here  a solid assistant that can tap into your calendar to make appointments set reminders and timers control the music from popular streaming services connect to some smart tvs and answer many  but not all  of the questions you can come up with on a daytoday basis,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,the experience of setting up and using google assistant has largely improved in the past threeandahalf years since it launched and really is as simple as downloading the google home app if you havent already logging in using your email and assigning it to a room,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,through the google home app you can setup multiroom groups that enable you to hear the same song across different speakers if you own more than one google assistant speaker and control any smart devices you own if youre too far away from the nest mini,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,youll also be able to use the app to select which services the nest mini defaults to when you ask it to play music  which is pretty crucial your choices include google play music spotify youtube music deezer or pandora but getting the nest mini to play a specific song requires a subscription to one of the above services which is kind of disappointing the google nest hub and nest hub max can play youtube music songs on command without a subscription with ads and its disappointing to find the same isnt true for the nest mini,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,the best workaround find a song on youtube you want to listen to on your phone and then connect via bluetooth to hear that song on the nest mini,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,music from the speaker is fairly middling  it has good clarity in the midrange thats perfect for speech reproduction but its not very musical especially in the high or bass ranges it will absolutely surprise you by how loud it can get but the fatiguing treble and anemic bass dont make for the best experience when listening to your favorite songs,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,because of the way its designed you also wont get any stereo separation when listening to the speaker  though you will get 360degree sound that allows you to put the speaker anywhere in the room especially in smaller rooms like a home office admittedly its not the best tradeoff if you love music but its one that google needed to make for a speaker of this size and purpose,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,the good news is that if youre coming from the original google home mini youll be hugely impressed with the improvements google made with this speaker to wit the nest mini uses three speakers one up over the home mini and has twice the bass response as the original home mini you still wont hear stereochannel separation but its still a big step up,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,while music isnt exactly the speakers strong suit it really does nail the midrange thats great if youre trying to hear the daily news over the dull roar of kitchen conversation and awesome for podcast fans who can never find a speaker that properly amplifies voices,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,if you want to try and add back in that treble or bass response you can attempt to do so through the google home app that we mentioned above but dont expect the nest mini to ever sound as good as its larger brethren the google home or google home max,,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,"smart home newcomers
despite its musical limitations and lack of an auxiliary port on the back the google nest mini is a solid speaker  especially at its incredibly low price point google assistant is clearly the killer feature here and its ability to tap into other smart devices is secondtonone",,,,web_scrape

Google Nest Mini,"amazon enthusiasts
it probably goes without saying but the google nest mini doesnt really interact much with any amazon product or service thats not a huge deal per se but admittedly we still like the amazon echo dot a bit more thanks to its more robust soundstage and inclusion of a lineout jack on the back the improvements google made to the nest mini make the fight closer than its ever been but we still think the amazon echo dot is the better option especially if you want better sound quality",,,,web_scrape
Google Nest Mini,"penny pinchers
yes the google nest mini is super cheap and we love that but that low entry price isnt so low if you want to tack on services like spotify premium or youtube music  either of which are needed for ondemand songspecific playback the nest mini will supply you with a playlist or will shuffle an artist freeofcharge but specificity is going to cost you  which is kind of a shame",,,,web_scrape

Apple HomePod Mini,the apple homepod mini is the tech giants smaller cheaper version of its flagship smart speaker the apple homepod which apple has now confirmed will be discontinued,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,its one of the cheapest devices apple has ever put out at 99  99  au149 its almost affordable for most although its going head to head with devices that can cost a fifth of that price at times with the amazon echo dot or google nest mini being seen as its chief rivals,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,however apple believes that a combination of its siri voice assistant and excellent sound quality will win the day  and there are a number of impressive things about this tiny wireless speaker,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the first of these is the setup process  youll need an iphone or ipad to use the homepod mini and you can simply hold your device near the new homepod mini and the connection is instant,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,all wifi passwords and accounts are synced and if youre setting up two speakers together theyll automatically pair after youve confirmed thats what you want to do it takes practically seconds to get up and running,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,this a very inoffensivelooking speaker too with a small spherical design that takes up far less space than the original homepod,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the latticed fabric housing blends nicely into the background and the top glows with a pleasing light  although we do wish there was an option to dim it or turn it off at night for when youre listening to calming music as youre drifting off to sleep,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,sign up for breaking news reviews opinion top tech deals and more,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,for us the audio performance is the key reason to buy the homepod mini its excellent for a speaker thats so small and it really feels like the right mix of value for money and sound quality the bass isnt too heavy vocals arent lost in the mix and when you pair two minis the stereo experience is really immersive,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,however if you dont have an apple music account youre rather limited when it comes to music streaming you cant ask the homepod mini to play anything through spotify  that can only be enabled through airplay and requires using your phone rather than the simpler method of asking siri to play tunes with your voice essentially youll need a subscription in order to make full use of your homepod mini,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,one of the biggest issues we encountered was when using the homepod as a smart voice assistant it works best if your family is set up with multiple apple devices but controlling your smart home devices with your voice is still hit and miss,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,we experienced multiple occasions when lights would turn on and off on command only for a lamp or plug socket to randomly stay on requiring us to issue a second command in order to get it to switch off if your voice commands dont work flawlessly every time using a smart speaker instantly becomes a frustrating experience,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,however if you like using siri and youve got an apple music subscription buying a couple of homepod minis should be an easy choice the sound quality is exceptional for the size and the interconnection with apples smart home is largely strong in spite of some issues,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,update you can now use the apple homepod mini as a speaker for the apple tv 4k,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the feature which was once only available on the now discontinued homepod was  announced during the companys annual wwdc keynote alongside ios 15 new upgrades for the airpods and watchos 8,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,both the homepod and homepod mini are still receiving updates the latest of which being the addition of spatial and lossless audio options in the current beta build while not everyone has access to this beta update as of yet its a good indication that spatial and lossless audio will roll out to all users soon,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the homepod mini launched on november 16 2020 and costs 99  99  au149,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,thats far cheaper than the original apple homepod which cost 349  319  au499 when it launched in 2018,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,that pricing also puts the homepod mini in direct competition with the new amazon echo 2020 which costs 9999  8999  au149  and it also shares a fairly similar spherical design,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,its not like apple to price its products at the more affordable end of the spectrum so perhaps the company is anticipating that people will buy more than one unit  as mentioned you can pair two to get stereo sound,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the apple homepod mini setup process is incredibly simple  its easily the best weve seen for any smart speaker especially if youve not owned a smart speaker before and are worried that setting one up would be a complicated business,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,once youve taken it out of the box and plugged it in youll be greeted with a small light that glows at the top of the speaker hold your iphone near to the homepod mini and youll get a notification that asks if youd like to connect  tapping this will activate the camera which you can use to find the swirling light on top,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,once its been located its then a few simple taps to transfer key information to the device  things like the wifi network are crucial as thats how the homepod mini communicates with the world around it and its great to not have to dig out your wifi password again,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,youll also have your apple id synced across as well as the choice of whether you want to enable it to just log information for you or allow personalized info for other people in your predefined household,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,all of this is handled through the home app on your iphone and this is also where youll be asked to assign your mini to a room so you can say things like play music in the bedroom as well as pair with another speaker if youve happened to buy an even number of homepod minis  once again these will be autodetected by your iphone and youll be presented with the pairing option,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the homepod mini design is  and we hate to describe it in this way  so very apple its understated minimal and attractive without being overbearing  it looks like what we imagine most people would have drawn if youd said sketch a small speaker from apple,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,perhaps the only thing theyd get wrong is that its spherical which allows it to pump out 360degree sound this is a move that amazons made with the new echo 2020 so its clearly in fashion but the sheer size or lack thereof of the homepod mini is what impresses especially when you consider the sound quality it offers which well get onto and laud in a moment,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the small sphere sits on a flat bottom and while its weighty enough to not get easily knocked around its got nowhere near the heft of the original homepod that lack of weight also means you wont need to worry about it marking the surface it sits on as could be the case with the larger homepod,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the speaker is covered with a gray or white mesh depending on your choice and the power lead plugs into a usbc charging block which thankfully is included in the box which isnt the case with the recent iphone 12 range,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,actually given that this charging block retails for 19  19  au29 theres actually something of a saving to be had here as you can use it to fastcharge an iphone too  although youll have to unplug the homepod mini while youre doing that,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,its a shame that apple didnt make the homepod mini portable with a small battery inside like the sonos move  but that would have increased the size and taken away from how impressively compact this little speaker is its easy to slot in discreetly around the home but equally it looks fine placed on top of a bedroom cabinet or prominently displayed on a shelf,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,if theres a single reason to buy the homepod mini its the sound quality were not used to saying this about many apple products but for the price youre getting excellent value for money in this respect,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,we noted above that the homepod mini design is similar to the new amazon echo 2020 in being spherical but that speaker doesnt have 360degree sound which apple has packed into the new homepod,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the sound is guided from the internal driver down to the base of the homepod where its fired outwards to create a more immersive sound,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,inside the homepod mini is the new s5 chipset which enables computational audio according to apple  in other words the homepod will analyze the song thats playing and alter the response of the speaker accordingly,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the ability to tweak the audio output on the fly to improve the sound quality in real time plus the use of a fullrange driver and two passive radiators makes for very impressive performance indeed  and the results speak for themselves,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,we tested it with a variety of different musical genres and while its not got the same oomph as the larger homepod its not that far off  and that device is far larger and more expensive,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the treble frequencies and vocals are really clear in every song punching through bassy tracks with ease  everything we tested had a good balance and even though the bass was often strong it wasnt overpowering for any genre,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the midtones were smooth especially in pop songs and cranking the sound levels didnt introduce distortion  if anything the roomfilling experience was enhanced at maximum volume,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,we had one instance where when using two homepod minis paired together they fell slightly out of sync but a restart fixed this it used to happen more regularly with the larger homepod a year or so ago so were wary of it but we only encountered it once,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,single instruments such as the twanging guitar on fleetwood macs the chain or a single instrument in mozarts jupiter carried a real resonance  perhaps the only criticism we could have was that classical music could see instruments getting a little lost in the wider orchestral movements but it was a minor and arguably fairly subjective issue,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,while the homepod mini wont dazzle audiophiles with its quality for the price and size its a very strong and capable speaker  apple is banking on the fact that good audio quality is going to sell here and for the average music listener youll find little to fault especially when two devices are paired,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,music handoff is a new feature that you wont find on the bigger homepod as it uses the ultra wideband chip the same one as those inside the iphone 11 and iphone 12 to know when one of those phones is being pointed at it,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,get close point your musicplaying phone at the homepod mini and a little rumble will tell you the music is now playing on the speaker to steal it back simply repeat the procedure and itll come off the small homepod and onto the phone again,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,its a really neat process and one that will delight those who want to just pass music like its magic or cant be bothered fumbling around looking for the airplay icon to play their music on a speaker,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,there is one thing we do wish apple would give us the option to control the light on the top of the homepod mini is illuminated when its playing music and that makes sense  but if youre using the speaker to help you get to sleep by playing rain sounds or mimicking the ocean and so on its rather bright,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,apple sorely needs a night mode for its speakers  as you want to be able to say hey siri goodnight and not have the homepod scream back ok the scene is set goodnight waking up half the household and lighting up the room when you want to keep listening to music,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,for some people the key reason to buy the new homepod mini isnt the audio quality impressive as it is for the price but the ability to connect your smart home to the world with minimal fuss,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,in that respect the homepod mini is a useful tool when it was announced alongside the iphone 12 apple went to great lengths to talk about how siri is such an intuitive assistant one that could easily help you on your phone in your car and when youre wandering around your home,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,wake up in the morning and ask it to play the news and itll give you an update on whats been happening from a local radio station ask it to alter your smart lights or control smart plugs as long as theyre connected to your home network and itll instantly switch them on and off as requested,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,these are all things that the homepod was capable of doing when we first reviewed it nearly three years ago and siri hasnt progressed massively as a smart assistant in that time,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,there are some more useful features on hand but it depends on how integrated you are with onboard apple apps youll need to be using the default calendar app to ask what appointments are coming up and having apple maps set up to learn about traffic on your commute,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,things like asking hey siri whats my update today will give you weather appointments and the latest news as a short podcast but we didnt use this functionality all that much,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,many of these are things that youd mostly do on your phone anyway rather than have audio firing out of your speaker and possibly waking up others in the household if you like your updates first thing in the morning,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,interacting with siri is pleasant enough with the cadence of its voice improved to be more naturalsounding in recent months  this is something google and amazon are trying to do with their assistants too and it makes a big difference,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,one thing that still needs improving is apples smart home integration getting devices to pair with your smart setup isnt too hard although there are a few steps to go through but so often we were met with the equivalent of a virtual shrug when trying to turn our smart devices on and off,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the amount of times we heard hmmm that device doesnt seem to be responding when asking siri to turn off a set of lamps was annoying especially so when we asked again and eventually found that it managed to comply,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,perhaps its a congested wifi network or just siri timing out but it made us lose faith in the system and just resort to turning things on or off manually at times  the homepod mini needs to be faster to act when it works and more consistent in its functionality,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,also new with the homepod mini is the intercom feature which enables you to tell siri via your phone or homepod to make announcements that are played on other homepod speakers in your home,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,its a little cumbersome to use as we found ourselves constantly rehearsing our lines to make sure it worked correctly hey siri announce in the living room im sorry for noise i just fell down the stairs was an awkward thing to say for a number of reasons but trying to remember how to phrase the announcement precisely took some getting used to,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,this feature is going to be expanded in the months to come  youll be able to make announcements on all devices connected to a household be it iphone or airpods so youll be able to announce things to your family from afar and know that everyone heard,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,this could be an issue  if someone is having a conversation in a room and you just butt in with an intercom message it might be a little intrusive we understand why apple built this feature in but we rarely used it except for novelty value during our testing,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the homepod mini is fine if you live alone but it can handle multiple users and is at its best in a bigger household,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,you need apple music to be able to command tracks with your voice  thats key to enjoying the homepod mini,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,siri can be anything from idiosyncratic to downright annoying at times  if you like the way it behaves youll enjoy the homepod mini a lot more,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,this is a speaker for those embedded in the apple ecosystem if you dont have an iphone but youre desperate for a homepod you can hack around it but its far from ideal,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,the homepod mini is so much more powerful when you put two together  the sound that the stereo setup brings really enhances the experience,,,,web_scrape
Apple HomePod Mini,apple needs to make the homepod more nighttime friendly and not be so loud or you need to find the perfect moment to ask it questions first thing in the morning,,,,web_scrape

Amazon Alexa,you can pick up the dot for under 50  50  au80 which makes it easy to see why the dot has been one of the most popular alexa speakers and smart speakers on the market to date we know many people that have two three and even more in their homes because theyre so useful,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,the amazon echo dot 2020 is the 4th generation dot and lives up to the legacy set down by all of the previous devices that came before it  its small decently loud and thanks to alexa its pretty smart too,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,however the unfortunate part of this version of the echo dot is that it seems to have many of the same foibles as its predecessors  it doesnt have a zigbee hub inside and the lineout jack while great for folks who have a big speaker system doesnt cater to the crowd who want to use the echo dot as a speaker for their audio player the sound is fine but audiolovers take note its not the bestsounding speaker in the world,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,if that bothers you youll be happy to hear that in late 2022 amazon unveiled a new amazon echo dot with improved audio as soon as it launches well be testing it to see if its a significant upgrade over all of the dots that came before it,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,in the meantime the 2020 version of the amazon echo dot while aesthetically different to the models that came before it brings more of the same as the 3rd gen model to your home this isnt necessarily a bad thing considering how much we loved that model and many that came before it but the amazon echo dot 2020 doesnt innovate enough to push it within range of a 4 or 45 star rating in our eyes  in case you were wondering,,,,web_scrape

Amazon Alexa,there arent many other cheap smart speakers available to buy right now but the closest competitor we think its worth mentioning here is the google nest mini thats supposed to cost 4999  49  au79 but is usually on sale for 35  35,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,amazon definitely took a different approach when it was coming up with the 4th generation amazon echo dot instead of a hockey puck shape like previous versions this echo dot is a palmsized sphere,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,like the larger amazon echo the amazon echo dots spherical chassis is divided into two parts a layer of hard mesh and a plastic back piece with rubber feet on the bottom so that it doesnt scratch your table youll also notice a plastic translucent ring along the bottom which serves as the led indicator light telling you when alexa is listening blue when the microphone is muted red or when the speaker has lost its internet connection yellow,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,on the top of the space agelooking speaker are four control buttons  volume up volume down microphone offon and a button that summons alexa you wont necessarily need to use them if you dont want to  as almost all of them can be replaced by voice commands  but theyre nice additions,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,if you turn the speaker around youll find a power connector and a 35mm aux jack that can be used as a line out port to send the audio signal to an external speaker thats an especially handy feature considering the echo dots lessthansterling sound quality that well discuss in a minute but its also somewhat disappointing that the 35mm aux jack doesnt double as a line in port like it does on the full size amazon echo,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,tear away the top layer of the amazon echo dot and youll find a single 16inch fullrange frontfiring speaker this tinybutpowerful speaker is responsible for producing the entire frequency range of sound for the speaker and the results well arent exactly inspiring,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,that said theres also the included microphone array packed inside there as well and we dont have any complaints about the echo dots ability to hear us over the dull roar of our music and process our commands perfectly,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,getting the speaker setup is simple  especially if you have one or more alexa devices already setup in your house if thats you all you need to do is head into the amazon alexa app and tap the plus icon in the devices section  the app will do a quick scan for nearby devices and before you know it youll be up and running with your new smart speaker,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,if you dont have the alexa or an echo device already installed youll have to go through the process of downloading the app and signing into your amazon account but then its more or less the same process as above,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,once its set up you can ask alexa to set timers create calendar events play music tell you the weather call other echo speakers and mobile phones and read the news as well as a host of other actions thanks to alexa skills,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,disappointingly while the amazon echo dot 2020 can control other smart home devices that youve previously paired with another amazon echo device it cant pair any devices on its own because it lacks a builtin zigbee hub you can ask alexa to do everything from turning your smart lights on to locking your front door but youll still need another amazon echo to set up those devices,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,while the echo dot really isnt a great buy for flourishing smart home enthusiasts the kids edition is great for parents who want a little more privacy for their little ones amazon has added a new feature alongside the echo dot in the form of alexa voice profiles for kids which allows alexa to automatically change its responses to be kidfriendly when it recognizes a childs voice is speaking to it,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,while using it in this mode amazon says children can ask alexa questions set animal sound alarms get help with homework and call approved friends and family and you wont have to worry about them getting into something they shouldnt theres also a new alexa feature called reading sidekick that helps with your kids reading and offers encouragement when theyre struggling thats perfect for quarantine learning,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,none of these features make up for the lack of a zigbee hub if youre looking to build out your smart home but for families the kids edition is a nice option that should allay parents fears of keeping a smart speaker around their kids,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,in terms of sound quality the amazon echo dot 2020 really hones in on the midrange presenting clear vocals in songs and emphasizing speech in podcasts conversely however the soundstage isnt particularly wide and instead is fairly shallow with little separation between instruments,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,now its spherical design might lead you to believe that it will offer 360degree sound but in actuality youre getting pretty focused directional audio thats at its best when youre standing a few feet in front of it thats not necessarily a bad thing but its worth noting,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,songs weve tested include pop hits like hey jude by the beatles and justin biebers lonely as well as some classic funk and rock as well the trend seems to be the same throughout great vocals in that midrange sweet spot but at the expense of the trebles and bass response that sound muted at almost any volume level like the larger echo you can tweak each of these areas individually by asking alexa to raise the bass midrange or treble but it doesnt radically impact the sound of the speaker,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,in terms of overall volume level the amazon echo dot gets moderately loud if you max it out however it doesnt seem to be able to hold that volume level for an extended period of time and eventually drops to a more sustainable level if youre looking for a good party speaker this isnt it,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,so what are you to make of the echo dots performance well as a desk speaker that sits in front of you and plays music for a halfhour at a time its perfectly fine  but as a home speaker that youll use to play songs during parties well the dot doesnt really cut it,,,,web_scrape
Amazon Alexa,"you want to extend alexas reach inside your house

Amazon Alexa,"you want to transform an older speaker into a smart speaker

Amazon Alexa,"this is the start to your smart home buying spree
if youre just starting out with smart home technology the amazon echo dot probably shouldnt be your first purchase yes it can control some devices that come with their own separate hubs but its severely limited without a zigbee hub of its own builtin",,,,web_scrape
