Amazon Alexa / Echo,"i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  i think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  i also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.i like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.",4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"i received my echo dot today in good condition, but be advised: i paid $29.99 for it and amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!set up with the dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone’s wifi settings. i called amazon customer service, and i dunno what it is, but lately i’ve been getting terrible support. the guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.i’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5ghz connection is strong. reconnecting is a pain each time as well.all that said, when alexa works, she works amazingly well. i don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing i really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. one of the more annoying limitations of apple’s siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “hey siri” feature is all but useless. alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. i haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so i’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.setting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your led devices (eg. rainbow effects), alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.all in all, my rating would’ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item. if the connectivity problems persist, i may have to exchange/return this item. i don’t want to though — alexa’s kind of growing on me.",3,12-Jun-18,Black,kaggle_amazon_alexa
Amazon Alexa / Echo,i bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. but i have no need for it. i only used it once. the volume was not loud enough for me when i played music while i was on my treadmill. so i rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.,5,11-Jun-18,Black,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,i love the echo spot. this bedside alarm clock size device can do what theecho show can do. i was concerned because i already had a large echo in mybedroom that answered to “alexa” like the other devices in my home. i wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when i discoveredthat i had other name choices (not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion).i named him “echo.” now if i could only choose a male voice. i loved that i could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell. so many more features. don’t forget to buy thestand/base. so many advantages to having that. read the reviews. highly recommend.,5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"we like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly.  you can even hear music played. the speaker is clear.  we are enjoying it.  what we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me.  the next day, i asked the echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song.  the echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before.  it was a little disconcerting.",5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,kaggle_amazon_alexa
Amazon Alexa / Echo,"i like echo spot. i bought it to use as an alarm clock. one negative that i didnt really think about, when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy, its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm, or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes. in this case a clock with buttons seems to work better",4,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"it's not perfect, but i really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. first, so i could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. second, i wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so i could shut it off as i was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. the echo spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. a bonus has been getting alexa to play music from my amazon prime playlists.what's not so great is that sometimes alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. hopefully the ai gets better in the future, along with added functions.",4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"as an alexa device, it works just as well as any of the other products.  unfortunately it doesn't go up from there.  the ability to play videos is very limited.  you can not play youtube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange. there is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and very annoying exception.  you can't turn off the &#34;things to try&#34; screen you can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  i don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things i can do with alexa.  i don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device.  overall, its an expensive alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.  i would not recommend this until the amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that's actually useful.",2,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"all is fine with the spot exact for one massive failing.  in order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  yes, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  but as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  this may be the biggest product design screw up amazon has ever made.",2,23-Jul-18,White  Spot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"i got this on prime day and figured i'd see what all the hype is about.  honestly i didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, i love it.  like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.i loved it so much i ordered 2.  i didn't get the show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  i have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where i can just say play any song i want and it will.  i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.the one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  i'd love for it to display the weather as i listen to music.the screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  i have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  so it really works great.the one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet.  the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot - the dot lights up colors - why can't the spot ?  the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.overall it's a great device that i am looking forward to integrating my home around.  i'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when i become a home owner instead of renting where i can't tinker with my thermostat i will be purchasing a nest down the road for hvac integration.",5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,bought the spot and loved it. within months it started acting funny and would stop working—called and they determined that it was overheating. i was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24-48 hours. waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week. a week goes by with absolutely no response so i do the inline chat per instructions. told to wait longer. really????  unacceptable—expected more from amazon. find it funny how they always thank me for being a prime member but when an issue arises i cannot even get assistance.,1,17-Jul-18,Black  Spot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"this is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  i use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  it doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having alexa repeat “ok alarm set for 5am.”  not good.  i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  no thanks, if i’m picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  at least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  there should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  it is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  when the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while i’m in the shower.",3,17-Jul-18,Black  Spot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"i haven't had my show very long or used it a lot, but i love it! i use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time. i also use it to check for different recipes, listen to music and my all time favorite.... telling everyone it is time for dinner. my son gets a real kick out of that!i know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment, but remember the original echo didn't have what it has now when it first came out. i see that amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon i am sure it will have all that we want very soon.... maybe even things we haven't thought of!i do wish it was a bit more user friendly. i still haven't figured out how to video chat with my cousin in north carolina who also has one, and when i tried to call my son's dot it went to video chat immediately, last i looked, dots don't have video screens!another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep, it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill i had enabled that was free. so now he is a bit worried to use it again. that needs to be fixed.i do have to say that all in all i am very happy with my echo show!",5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"works great i bought this direct from amazon, and i have got to tell you, this item echo show and echo plus is the best item i have ever had and i am kind of a tech geek. i am a disabled person, and it helps me turn light on and off, and schedule doctor appointments, using google voice phone, and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. i wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. they are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off. thank god, no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights. thank you amazon. i will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. jeff bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability i was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event. really helped when all you earn a month is $672 on ssdi thank you all again.",5,23-Jul-18,White  Plus,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"we are a long time amazon prime family, many years, but new to the alexa world and thought the purchase of alexa plus, with hub, and included phillips hue light bulb would be a great start. alexa does a lot of good things for us like alarm in the morning, verbalize books, playing music on command, even linked to my sirrius/xm account. good daily stuff. good sound, but not bose. but, the ads say &#34;hub included&#34; so don't need anything else to operate devices. well, not so. i understand there will be some differences in product device  support. the fact that it came with the hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. the bulb is capable of so much more with the hue app but the hue app does not recognize alexa hub as a bridge. so, it appears you do have to get a philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. that can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. the list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge. was very disappointed to find that out after the fact, to the point i feel we are being misled by amazon by included the hue bulbs without explanation. maybe throw a good discount my way to get the hue bridge if i keep the echo plus before i invest in more light bulbs.",3,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"i got it to try side by side with the echo originale. they are essentially the same in dimension, weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub. as many folks already pointed out, the hub is not a direct replacement for the philips hue, z wave or anything else. it provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub. for me, the voice recognition and music play capability is the same, the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i don't really need the hub with less functionality. in addition, i don't think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. my philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs fw and they fixes bugs. net net for me, this echo does not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not as good. with the  original echo available as refurbished i would check that out first before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these.",4,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"incredible piece of technology.i have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter. the mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good. i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and 360 sound more appealing. it's no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass. the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building. the knob on the top works great for adjusting volume. this is my first echo device and i would imagine having to press volume buttons (on the echo 2) a large inconvenience and not as precise. for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo (2nd generation).the piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it. the rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter-- my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over.this order came with a free philips hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought. i put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp, turned on the light, and all i had to do was say &#34;alexa, connect my devices&#34;. the default names for each bulb was assigned as &#34;first light&#34; and &#34;second light&#34;, so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned on/off one of the lights by saying &#34;alexa, turn off the second light&#34;. in the alexa app, i created a 'group' with &#34;first light&#34; and &#34;second light&#34; and named the group &#34;the light&#34;, so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining i just say &#34;alexa, turn on the light&#34;.i was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the echo plus with its built in hub. i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug. apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb! i was surprised by that. awesome.you will feel like tony stark on this device. i added quite a few &#34;skills&#34; like 'thunderstorm sounds' and 'quote of the day' . alexa always loads them up quickly. adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great feature.i can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.i was lucky to buy this for $100 on prime day, but i think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the echo 2 is only $100. in my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) taller and 360 sound unit.2) volume knob on top that you spin (i think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) built in hub for hue bulbs. after researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. for me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.i highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now.",5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"recently cut the cord on cable television. needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap. ordered the amazon fire stick from best buy. instructions were short and easy to follow. i was going to order the amazon ethernet adapter because i was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought i'd wait and see. glad i did. wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. a few brief hiccups here and there, but i'm convinced that was from the apps themselves. don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what i used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. amazon fire stick is limited to 1gb of memory and 8gb of storage. thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading apps and recording shows. so far it hasn't been any issue at all. the upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of nfl football, might prove more troublesome when i need to record more often. i'll worry about that then. my only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. the screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded apps and recorded shows stay in memory. not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. haven't tried it yet, although i don't think it'll be an issue with directtv now, which i'm using right now. so far i'm loving the amazon fire stick. actually love that amazon, which i use occasionally, come pre-installed.",5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"for the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. so definitely no complaints there. the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. first, i didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. so i really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker, don’t. lastly, i’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but i haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “alexa”.",2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,this is so much fun to play with - i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of - alexa learns from the questions i ask. she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it. when i want the current weather she tells me. ask her what going on in the city she knows. call a friend she will dial ( i haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,weak sound. compared to the google home mini the sound is bad. also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything. also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both. i think it's lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices.,2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better. i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo. i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. oh well it is what it is and i still love it. i'm just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,"for the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. so definitely no complaints there. the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. first, i didn’t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. so i really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker, don’t. lastly, i’m sure the echo dot can do a lot but i haven’t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually “alexa”.",2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,we put one in the bedroom.  it plays music and tells us the weather.  it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning.  it is better than a clock radio.  it will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites.  it can even tell jokes.  i don't know how i got along without it before now.  amazing.,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,this is so much fun to play with - i just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off i tell alexa to turn it of - alexa learns from the questions i ask. she will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. if i wake up in the middle of the night i do not have to turn on a light i just ask alexa what time is it. when i want the current weather she tells me. ask her what going on in the city she knows. call a friend she will dial ( i haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.,5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,kaggle_amazon_alexa

Amazon Alexa / Echo,i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better. i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo. i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker. oh well it is what it is and i still love it. i'm just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but doesn't take up a whole lot of space.,4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,kaggle_amazon_alexa
