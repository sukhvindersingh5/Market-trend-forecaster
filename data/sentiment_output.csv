youtube,Google Nest Mini,These suck! This is designed for android users. Anyone with an Iphone or memberships like itunes  will have a very annoying time. Once you have figured out how to add your nest to your google home app and configured everything. You come to realize that just like apple downgrades android messages to a god awfull low resolution grainy immage. Google disconnects itunes or you library every 2-3 minutes so your song will go thru beeps and pauses as it tries to reestablish connection. It only happens with apple developed apps. I exchanged it twice until the realization set in. So just avoid it apple users. Last time I tried was october 2024 and it still disconnects my music.,Negative,-0.16666666666666666

youtube,Apple HomePod Mini,"I don't know how anyone can recommend this.  I have had Amazon Echo for years and it works very well (especially with Amazon's own Smart Plugs, compared to Wemos which are AWFUL).  The Amazon Echo is easy to use and intuitive to speak to, and it talks all the time, even in Brief mode.  It routinely adds, ""By the way"" after it does something and also asks if it did what I wanted.  It never shuts up.  It also feels the need to tell you ""Now connected to MacBook Pro"" when you shoot music over to it just a few feet away, even though you've already heard the music playing from it, and it then INTERRUPTS the music to tell you that.  Super annoying on a daily basis.  But absolutely nothing is well thought out in comparison on the Apple HomePod mini.  Even simple things on Echo like adding to a grocery list, reading it off, and then telling it to empty the list is easy on Echo, while a real chore on HomePod mini.  I can tell Siri on my iPhone to play my iTunes playlist named whatever and it starts playing it but not on HomePod Mini.  To do that I have to start it on my phone manually and then use AirPlay to shoot it over to the HomePod Mini.  Everything on the HomePod mini compared to the Amazon Echo is clumsy and challenging and mind boggling difficult in comparison, and is simply unintuitive (the former hallmark of Apple under Steve Jobs was always that it was intuitive).  I also took advantage of Apple Music streaming service for 6 months with this purchase, only to fight with it an entire day and end up deleting it.  Ask it to play something like Somewhere Over the Rainbow by Judy Garland and it refused, giving me some other funky version.  Then ask it to play music by Judy Garland and the very first song was Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  It's just unimaginably bad in every way and so I cancelled Music even though it's free and am returning the HomePod mini after day two.",Neutral,0.0042328042328042366

I have 5 HomePods, big and small, but the only thing I find them really good for is Dolby Atmos for my AppleTV. The Homepod represents an epic fail by Apple. Have you ever tried troubleshooting.
